```
[Verse 1]
The world we knew
Is swallowed up in an ashen haze
We sit in darkness and count the days as they slip by

[Verse 2]
Trapped down below
The bitter end looming overhead
I can't remember the words you said to me back then

[Pre-Chorus]
The past is out of sight
Too far away to reach
So turn and face the night
We'll leave behind these faded memories

[Chorus]
I'll take the fire from the stars
Hold out the light and make it ours
I'll find a new path out from beneath the dust (Beneath the dust)
I'd fly to distant suns and back
Burn up to lead us through the black
To the world I always promised you
So we'll set it all ablaze and start anew

[Verse 3]
Remember how
I'd pick those fights that I couldn't win
And yet I thought that I was invincible somehow
So innocent
Now I see just how weak I am
Only God knows what calamities we'll face

[Pre-Chorus]
But though the path I tread
Could lead to my demise
I'll gladly face the end
If even there's a chance to change the tides

[Chorus]
I'll take the fire from the stars
Hold out the light and make it ours
I'll find a new path out from beneath the dust (Beneath the dust)
I'd fly to distant suns and back
Burn up to lead us through the black
To the world I always promised you
So we'll set it all ablaze and start anew

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
What we've lost, we're never getting back
But we can stop the rest from falling through the cracks
When hope is all but dead and gone
We'll stand our ground until the break of dawn
The time is now, there's nowhere left to hide
We've got no choice but to cast our fear aside
'Cause I can set our world and others free
And I will be the hero that you see in me
[Chorus]
Let's start a fire with a spark
Pierce through the never-ending dark
Carve out a place where there's still a chance for us (Beneath the dust)
Within a world that has no light
We'll be the ones to reignite
Take our freedom back just me and you (Beneath the dust)
I'll take the fire from the stars
Hold out the light and make it ours
I'll find a new path out from beneath the dust (Beneath the dust)
I'd fly to distant suns and back
Burn up to lead us through the black
To the world I always promised you
So we'll set it all ablaze and start anew
